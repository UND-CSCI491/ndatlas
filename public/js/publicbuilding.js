According to an email from Doug Hogan with Jamestown Parks and Recreation, the building was used for some time as an indoor skating rink, but was demolished sometime in the 1960’s. The town referred to the building as a “hippodrome” probably due to its large, curved sides. Since the building is no longer standing, one must rely on written descriptions and one photograph of the exterior. North Dakota: A Guide to the Northern Prairie State was written by another department of the New Deal, The WPA Federal Writer’s Project. The guide describes the building as, “[A] domical building, the design of its façade carried out in the straight lines and angles of modern architecture. Constructed with laminated truss-type arches which support the entire roof load, the auditorium has 25,000 sq. ft. of floor space unobstructed by supporting columns. Its acoustics is excellent owing to the vaulted shape of the roof and the absorbing quality of the timbers in the arches.” According to Hogan, the footprint of the building can still be seen at McElroy Park today. It is currently an outdoor skating rink.</p>");
