Designed by J. Howard Ness of Fargo, the courthouse is one of nine buildings in North Dakota built using the Art Deco – Art Moderne style.

When ground broke in 1934, twenty local men desperately in need of work were employed to build the Post Office. The building is built in a style called starved classicism and is known for being very sparsely ornamented, if at all.

The auditorium was to be located within the spacious McElroy Park, which is still in use today although the auditorium is long gone. According to an email from Doug Hogan with Jamestown Parks and Recreation, the building was used for some time as an indoor skating rink, but was demolished sometime in the 1960’s. The town referred to the building as a “hippodrome” probably due to its large, curved sides. Since the building is no longer standing, one must rely on written descriptions and one photograph of the exterior. North Dakota: A Guide to the Northern Prairie State was written by another department of the New Deal, The WPA Federal Writer’s Project. The guide describes the building as, “[A] domical building, the design of its façade carried out in the straight lines and angles of modern architecture. Constructed with laminated truss-type arches which support the entire roof load, the auditorium has 25,000 sq. ft. of floor space unobstructed by supporting columns. Its acoustics is excellent owing to the vaulted shape of the roof and the absorbing quality of the timbers in the arches.” According to Hogan, the footprint of the building can still be seen at McElroy Park today. It is currently an outdoor skating rink.</p>");

The Memorial Hall was built in the Art Moderne style, as many Federal Relief projects were. According to Steven Martens’ Multiple Place Form for Federal Relief construction in North Dakota, the architectural firm of VanHorn and Ritterbush from Bismarck were responsible for the design of the project. The building has seen a few renovations since its creation. In February 2016, The Dickinson Press, released a story about the current renovations taking place at the Memorial Hall. According to the article, the building has tried to retain all of the original character of the 1936 construction.

It is characterized by its rounded corners, a low, horizontal profile, and circle-window doors in the courtroom. The façade is mostly brick, except for a parapet that is covered in Kettle River sandstone brought to the site from Minnesota. The name “Memorial Court House” is still present on the frieze.

The town had to undertake a $100,000 bonded indebtedness, but the vote passed with little resistance because the Stark County residents were encouraged by the progress. The building boom in the county was a good sign that they had made it through the worst part of the Depression.

The building also was the recipient of a WPA-commissioned artwork by Leo J. Beaulaurier in 1939, entitled “Indians Demanding Toll from Wagon Train for Crossing Their Land.” Beaulaurier had mistaken the Red River cart trails to resemble those of the Santa Fe Trail in the south, so the mural is out of place, but interesting nonetheless.</p>");
