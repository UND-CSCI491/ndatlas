            <h2 id="title">Ghost Towns and Near Ghost Towns of North Dakota</h2>
            <div id="content">
			<div class="section">The state of North Dakota has enjoyed a period of incredible economic success over the past seven years, despite an extremely poor financial climate across the United States. However, this success often overshadows the failed portions of North Dakota.  In the last half century the population of the state has undergone a population shift from a rural community, to an urban one. But what happened to these communities that were left behind? What of the ghost towns that lay scattered across the prairie? What brought people to these places in the first place, and what drew them out? Why do some towns fail and others thrive? Still, despite what these ghost towns and near ghost towns lack in population, they remain intimately related to the history of state and its development since entering the union.</div>
			<div class="section">Before delving too deeply into the ghost towns of North Dakota, it’s important to understand how a “ghost town” was defined for this work. It is also important to remember that the title “ghost town” or “near ghost town” is not, nor is it intended to be a slight on the place name in question. It is simply a site in the state that meets the works definition of a ghost town.</div>
			<div class="section">A ghost town is defined as a site that had officially established a post office, and then had that post office disestablished. This does not include farm post offices or railroad sidings, however, as they generally do not imply gatherings of people beyond an immediate family. Because of the criteria used within our definition, some of the sites still have small populations, and instead qualify as “near ghost towns.” This does not remove them from the discussion of the states shift in population distribution, and the “deaths” of towns across the state because even though they still have a population, the cities themselves are decreasing in size.</div>
			<h2>The Railroads</h2>
			<div class="section">When examining the locations of towns in the state of ND, it’s important to start with the railroads.  There were two major lines that affected the state in this way. They are the Northern Pacific Railroad, and The Great Northern Railroad. These two lines cut across the state and divide it into three portions: The north, central, and south. Along these major lines, towns were placed every twenty or so miles, and various sub-routes would cover the entire state. These sub-routes reflected the ambition of the railroad for the state, but would also end up becomeing the cause of the many ghost towns and near ghost towns that dot the state.</div>
			<div class="section">The Northern Pacific Railroad was the first to enter the state. It started on the eastern edge of the red river valley and passed through what are now Fargo, Valley City, Jamestown, and Bismarck. Jay Cooke (the major financer of the operation) intended to run a line from Duluth, Minnesota to the west coast, as a means of creating an artificial “North West Passage” which was at the time, absent from the hemisphere. Fargo was reached by 1872, and by the following year, what would later become Bismarck was connected to the line. Along the route, survey crews were often attacked by the Native American populations of the territory which required protection from the US Army, driving up the cost of building substantially. As the line progressed, the terrain became harder to maneuver and they realized that they had drastically underestimated the cost of the railroad. Cooke and Company was forced to delay the completion of the line until about 1880. In all, the Railroad would lay 1,460 miles of track and found 175 town sites.</div>
			<div class="section">The other major line that entered the state was the Great Northern Railroad. James J Hill acquired the line after it had fallen on hard times and began the build into North Dakota, starting in 1878. By 1885, Devil’s Lake had been reached, but Hill was also very interested in expanding the Minnesota lines, so the project took well into the 1890s to complete. Along the way, Hill was certain to give the Northern Pacific a run for its money. He added lines that curved south and offered competition to communities in the central portion of the state, particularly bonanza farms (which will be discussed in detail later). Grand Forks, and Devil’s lake were the two major cities on this line, they served as the population centers in this part of the state but rural communities also existed in the area.</div>
			<div class="section">Additionally, Northern Pacific was convinced that a town should be plotted every twenty miles of line, and so was Great Northern.  This resulted in many sites that were plotted but never actually built. Despite this, the presence of the railroads in North Dakota was incredibly substantial. In 1890, the state had 110 miles of track for every 10,000 people, as compared to the national average of 26 miles for every 10,000. At its completion it had laid down 2,027 miles of track in North Dakota, (more than any other line) and created 275 town sites.</div>
			<div class="section">Although not as prominent in the states foundation, a third rail company, The Soo Line Railroad, entered the state in Hankinson, in the South east corner of the state in 1891. The line made its way through Valley City, reached Harvey by the end of 1892, and ended at Portal, ND in 1893 by way of Minot.</div>
			<h2>Bonanza Farms</h2>
			<div class="section">Around the same time the main lines were being built, many people were being drawn into the state to work the Bonanza farms (The get rich quick scheme of the time). Essentially, a bonanza farm was a massive piece of property that was owned by a wealthy benefactor, and worked by day laborers, similar to the southern plantations, but with a more “boom and bust” destiny. In some, 91 farms were created, each having a minimum of 3,000 acres. As a result a large influx of people were brought into the state, and as the bonanza fad wore out, homesteading North Dakota became popular. Many would work a season or town on the farms and then make a claim further west with their saved wages (men rarely had an opportunity to spend their money as they had food and housing provided, and were nowhere near any shopping centers or bars).</div>
			<div class="section">Eventually word about the excellent farming conditions of the state spread across the nation and even spilled over into some parts of Europe. This was due in large part to the railroads, which needed buyers for all the land they were acquiring in the state. Groups entered the state as colonies and though many found the prairie too difficult to settle, those that did formed close-knit communities, scattered across the state. Entering into the 20th Century, many of these communities began to develop enough wheat for the railroad to build stops. Unfortunately, the Agriculture industry was unforgiving for the new North Dakotans and many of the small towns that developed in the late 1900s and early 1910s were almost immediately abandoned in favor of towns with more railroad action.</div>
			<div class="section">The first problem prospective homesteaders faced when entering the state was the sheer difficulty of homesteading in the Prairie. Building supplies were scant, the state was unnaturally cold (especially in the eastern half where there was little terrain features to slow the winter winds), and starting a farm required a certain amount of devotion that many were simply not willing to put in, or were unable to.</div>
			<div class="section">Bonanza farms had created some unrealistic expectations for many that decided to homestead. The men that worked the farms often only worked one or two seasons before making their own claims within the state, and since they were paid per diem they could leave the farms year round to make their claims. Unfortunately however, the bonanza farms had offered security in ways that homesteading couldn’t. The bonanza farms were set up in a kind of feudal system, giving the men that worked on them meals, and housing similar to the man camps that emerged at the beginning of the 2006 oil boom. Homesteaders however had to pay for their own food, build their own houses, and wait until the end of season to turn a profit. Working as a farm hand on a bonanza farm was certainly one of the most difficult vocations a man could take at the time, but compared to homesteading, it was a cakewalk. If your family homesteaded, and did so successfully, they were an incredibly resilient group.</div>
			<div class="section">Of course not everyone could make it, and the results are shown in the abandoned rural post offices that dotted the state from 1880 to 1900. Of the approximately 40,000 prospective claimants only 16,000 “proved” their claim, to say nothing of those men that had purchased their land from the railroads outright. These were the short lived sites that lasted only long enough for those they serviced to realize that North Dakota is not for everybody. These sites are not so much “Ghost Towns” in that they were never really towns to begin with. Those that would last were generally closer to the eastern edge of the state, and would bloom into minor town sites before fading into the 1940s.</div>
			<div class="section">After these sites were settled, of course they needed to be un-settled. There is no one rule or reason for why certain towns lasted and others did not. Usually it was a combination of issues that resulted in their ultimate demise. That said, when examining the post office records, minor patterns emerged regarding the time frame in which towns fell. These time frames (or exoduses), are not hard and fast rules, but they can be used to explain generally why towns died during a given time period. The first exodus ran from the 1910s through the 1920s, the second exodus ran from the mid-1930s to the 1940s, and the final exodus began in the 1960s and continues to this day, though it has slowed considerably since the 1980s.</div>
			<h2>The First Exodus</h2>
			<div class="section">The First exodus was really a decisive test that came down to two factors: railroads and spirited initiative and resourcefulness. As previously mentioned the railroads acted as the backbone of development along the state. The plan originally had been to lay a town every twenty miles of line, but this was optimistic at best. Many came to the state and platted town sites that the railroads never ended up reaching, leaving them without service, or any way to easily sell their harvest. These communities were often exclusive to their original members. Farmers mistrusted townsfolk and townsfolk looked down on the “country jake” farmers. These self-isolating communities usually dwindled quickly and died within 10 years of their original founding, and in most cases, leaving nothing behind.</div>
			<div class="section">The other problem these towns faced was the resolve of the people who settled them. Again, North Dakota is not a forgiving state, and the late comers who settled the state during the early 1900s and 1910s who could not deal with the weather usually fell out during this exodus, after only five years or so.</div>
			<h2>The Second Exodus</h2>
			<div class="section">The first exodus cleared out a good portion of the farming communities, but the second saw the death of what we would recognize as “towns”. Those who survived the 1910s and 1920s would now have to deal with both a depression economy, and the dust bowl. Many had to give up either parts, or all of their farms to the state and move into more urban communities. This was, at first, a good thing for the smaller towns in the state, as they saw an overall rise in population as farmers gave up their vocation, but this growth did not last. These towns ended up being a transitional site for many who would ultimately move to larger towns like Fargo or Devils Lake or give up on the state all together, ultimately leaving to find their fortunes elsewhere.</div>
			<div class="section">As we know, the depression and dust bowl would eventually end, but at this point; many were turned off to the idea of farming, and North Dakota altogether. After being betrayed by the land, those that had stuck it out worked their way out of debt and then left the state to help in the war effort. North Dakota had received the smallest national grant for building a war industry so many packed up and sought their fortunes in the factories of America or found themselves in uniform. </div>
			<h2>The Third Exodus</h2>
			<div class="section">The Final mass exodus of the state occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. Those towns that had appeared to hang on were suddenly going by the way side. The cause of all these towns suddenly vanishing is far more varied that the last two exoduses. However they ultimately boil down to the urbanization and mechanization of the nation as well as the boom and bust cycles that the energy economy experienced.</div>
			<div class="section">In North Dakota, much like the rest of the country at the time, the general population collectively decided that city life seemed to be the ideal. In general, the younger generation was more interested in pursuing their futures in larger communities. The farms across the state that had managed up to this point would stay largely untouched by this population shift, but small towns in North Dakota and across the nation were greatly affected. Everyone seemed to know that life in the (relatively) big cities of Bismarck, Fargo, and Minot was simply better than the small town life they were accustomed to and began to leave for the states bigger cities or leave the state all together and seek their fortune elsewhere. </div>
			<div class="section">This move toward urbanization was assisted by what is commonly referred to as mechanization. This is came to be in a few different ways. First, into the 1950s automobile ownership rose rather quickly. Most homes went from being a no vehicle household to owning two to three cars on average, allowing for greater mobility. Suddenly, families could travel much further than ever before, and shop in the super shopping centers of larger communities, leaving small town general stores unable to compete. Also, it was no longer necessary to have a town every twenty miles to stop in. With the ability to travel further, many towns became abandoned and forgotten.</div>
			<div class="section">Another facet of mechanization was the advancement of farming. With advancements in tractors, combines and reapers, the required manpower on farms dropped dramatically. With less work to be found in the country, many men were forced to provide for themselves another way. What is more, factory farming emerged as a new and competitive facet of the agricultural economy and in some cases, forced farmers out of the industry entirely.
			</div>
			<div class="section">Lastly, the interstate was a destructive force against the soon to be ghost towns of North Dakota.  Though many across the nation would benefit from more direct roads and standardized routes, small towns suffered. Towns that were bypassed by the interstate would be left to vanish, with no way to attract outside business to support the local economies and no way to draw in younger populations.</div>
			<div class="section">As a result, the average age dramatically rose among smaller towns. With no young people to bring life to the aging populations, they began to die. Despite the gradual shift that had begun to take place, the overall population of the state was constantly changing at the time. In the 1970s an energy boom and bust cycles overtook the state, attracting temporary workers to help drill for oil and mine shale. This led to a rise in population to some extent and provided some of the small western towns the ability to “hang on” into the 1980s.</div>
			<div class="section">The result of this energy boom was not only a lagging state economy but it also served as a detriment to the infrastructure due to the high traffic of heavy equipment. The state was not adequately prepared, for the growth and was therefore unable to maintain it. When the energy economy “busted” it left many small towns to pick up the bill for the infrastructure they had supplied. With these debts mounting, many small town businesses were forced to close, and the city became even more appealing. The majority of those who intended to leave had gone by the early 1980s but this urbanization exodus is ongoing to some extent.</div>
			<h2>What Remained</h2>
			<div class="section">What remained after these major exoduses varies based on the time period they left? Obviously little remains of the towns that fell apart during the first exodus, and there are still a few people living in “dead” towns across the state that collapsed during the third exodus. You might only find a building or two today when visiting old town sites, or you might end up staring at the prairie, unable to tell the difference between what was once town and what was once country.</div>
			<div class="section">Generally, if you find your way to a building at an old town site it will be a home, general store or church. Dilapidated barns, sheds, and houses are far and away the most common structures left abandoned.  This is mostly because when a town “dies” that does not necessarily mean that it’s population has left entirely. It was very common for people to stay in their community after their post office closed. This was mostly due to either financial restrictions or family traditions. Many young couples would stay until it was time to retire, and they could afford to move into a more urban environment. </div>
			<div class="section">If the town had done fairly well at drawing people from their farming communities during the second exodus, only to die in the third, other structures can usually be found. General stores or specialty welders seem to be popular as are churches, which usually account for the reason these towns were survive unil it into the 1960s. Farmers surrounding these towns commonly gave patronage to these business and congregations, helping them last longer, even though populations dwindled.</div>
			<div class="section">Finally, one can hardly be surprised to find the remnants of the railroad scattered across the state, much like a massive fossil that tells the story of the state’s past. Stations exist in the majority of the third exodus sites that still have structures standing. Unfortunately, it wasn’t uncommon to have lines pulled up when the profit’s dried up. Often these lines would be resold or repurposed for use on more profitable lines.</div>
			<h2>Arena</h2>
			<div class="section">The First site worth review is Arena, this site was chosen because it is an excellent example of a third exodus town, and still has many visible structures including a church, various homes, general store, and school.</div>
			<div class="section">Arena’s history is tied to its location. Situated in Burleigh County, organized in 1873 by Dr. Walter Burleigh. Burleigh had come to the territory because he had been named Indian Agent of Dakota Territory for his support of Abraham Lincoln’s 1861 presidential election and was awarded a contract to grade Northern Pacific Railroad land.  Burleigh founded the creatively named “Burleigh City” (also referred to as Burleightown and Burleighton) in 1872 and had intended to use insider information to draw people in to his settlement and make it a railroad trade hub. The NPRR however, disliked the corruption that existed within Burleigh and the location he had chosen was often subject to spring flooding, making it a less than ideal town site.</div>
			<div class="section">Instead they adjusted the line to pass through Edwinton, and renamed the site Bismarck in 1873 in an effort to attract German investors. Bismarck would go on to be a trade hub for the railroad as the Soo Line entered the city in 1873, and became the capital of Dakota Territory in 1883. Though this role would be diminished when the line was finished being constructed into Montana, it still attracted many to the area.About 50 miles northeast of this site, Arena was founded on January 23rd 1906, building off of the success of the county.</div>
			<div class="section">Who came first to the site remains unclear, but Harry A. Mutchler was the founder of the 1906 post office, and the man who christened the site. He named it Arena in large part because the site was nestled in a shallow sandy valley giving it the appearance of a natural arena. Around the same time, North Dakota was experiencing it’s “Second Boom” in population, due mostly to an advertising campaign led by Great Northern and the State Legislature. In 1910, the Northern Pacific connected Arena to their larger network via the Pingree-Wilton line. By 1920, the town claimed a population of 150 and well developed sense of community.  This had developed between farmers as they collaborated with each other in order to receive better prices for their grain by selling in bulk.</div>
			<div class="section">The majority of the county identified as Germans from Russia in 1910 and  Arena was no different. The town appeared much as you would expect any small town to in the 1910s and 1920s. Homes and businesses were organized along “main street,” and grain elevators were erected. The site had a one-room schoolhouse that was likely built when the town was founded as well as a larger brick school that was built in 1922. The only church, St. John’s Lutheran Church of the Missouri Synod was founded by Reverend August Hoeger, a deeply devote minister who had dreams of foreign ministry.</div>
			<div class="section">So what drove them out? Because the town was a third exodus small town, many of those same issues apply. Arena peaked in 1920 with a population of 150, but in the matter of a decade the plummeted to only 35. The town would hang on after World War Two but the church closed in 1940 after Reverend Hoeger moved his family to Fargo. The Wing congregation instead serviced the community. Additionally, if the Arena cemetery is any indication, large amount of the towns’ residents were dying off between 1920 and 1930. Likely, many had passed away due to poor farming conditions of the period, hindering the local economy as a whole. It also appears that in this particular period there was a slight uptick in the deaths of young people as evidenced by the individuals contained within the Arena graveyard. It also appears that the younger population had begun to move away from Arena at this time. Despite being the “baby boomer” generation, few who are buried in Arena were born in the 1940s, indicating that those that were born in the 1940s chose to be buried elsewhere, likely in the new homes they established in larger cities across the state. </div>
			<div class="section">We know then that the population of Arena was growing older without a younger generation to replace it. With no church, the school closing in the 1980s there was nothing left to maintain the population. The post office closed in 1972, and by 2004, the town was officially abandoned. We are left with the church, a few homes, and the foundation of the second school building.</div>
			<h2>Bucyrus</h2>
			<div class="section">Bucyrus is not a traditional ghost town, in the sense that it is not technically abandoned.  Instead it is classified as a “near ghost town.” As of 2014, 27 residents could be found in Bucyrus, spread across 11 households. The town can be found in the southwestern portion of the state along the Milwaukee Road Railroad. It is located in Adams County (founded in 1907), and named for President John Quincy Adams.  Originally, the town was named Wolf Butte, but quickly changed the name to Dolan. The name came from one of the towns original settlers, C.R. Dolan.  Dolan had been an employee of the Milwaukee Road Railroad, and decided to stay and open a general store after grading the site. Unfortunately, the town was often confused with Doland, South Dakota, and was promptly renamed “Bucyrus” in February of 1908. </div>
			<div class="section">To say that Bucyrus had a very unlucky history would be an understatement. In 1923 at least three family farms surrounded Bucyrus were destroyed by a tornado that tore its way through the region. The Tornado killed two residents and another three were seriously injured. Because of its role in the grain trade, the town succeeded, but never truly flourished. The population peaked at only 124 in 1930, and has been declining ever since. The poor farming conditions of the state can account for the first decline in population. The town depended upon farmers’ success to store and ship grain, and because the drought of the 1920s and 1930s had hindered that, some left the town to make money as a member of the war time industry during the second World War. Luckily, since Bucyrus was situated between two more developed communities (Bowman and Hettinger), the town was able to survive on through traffic into the post war world.</div>
			<div class="section">By the 1950s the population had fallen steadily to 111 but by 1960 that number was almost cut in half, leaving only sixty people. This was due to the mechanization and urbanization of the state, and would continue to take away from the success of the town to the end. By 1980 that number had halved again, reaching thirty-two, and in 1984 the post office closed.</div>
			<div class="section">The drop in population can be accounted for by considering its location. Bucyrus is situated on highway 12, between Bowman and Hettinger. When automobiles became more accessible to the public in the 1950s, it became part of the path, rather than a stop along the way. Really, the reason Bucyrus has dwindled is not so much what the town did wrong, rather it is what Bowman and Hettinger did right.</div>
			<div class="section">Both Bowman and Hettinger were built along the Milwaukee Road line and settled in 1907. They boast populations of about 1600, and 1200 respectively, and are both county seats of Bowman and Adams County. Bowman is west of Bucyrus, at the intersection of Highway 12 and Highway 85, making it a high traffic location. Bowman and Hettinger also have their own airports and high schools, something Bucyrus could never claim. More importantly both towns have multiple businesses, while the only form of income for Bucyrus is farming and their grain elevator. The problem was that there was simply more to do in the surrounding towns, drawing young people into the (relatively) larger cities, and contributing to the aging of Bucyrus.</div>
			<div class="section">Twenty-six people remain today, sticking things out through the ups and downs. In 2012, a wildfire passed through the town, destroying four homes, two abandoned barns and the only business in the town; a picture framing shop. Recovery efforts were swift however, and donations flooded in to support the town. In August of the very next year, a new Japanese grain elevator opened, capable of storing up to one million bushels of grain. The elevators received so much business from across the state they were unable to keep up at first, but are now competing well with other elevators accross North Dakota. Unfortunately, this has yet to contribute to any serious population growth with only one other person moving into town.</div>
			<div class="section">All that remains of the town are various homes, mostly in different stages of dilapidation. A few older grain elevators still remain as well as Bucyrus Lutheran Church and a small playground. Finally, south of town, is the Bucyrus Cemetery, which has a residence of 197, far more than the towns itself. This town, like many third exodus towns, has simply fallen victim to a combination of mechanization and an aging population.</div>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<div class="section">Like the rest of the state, North Dakota’s ghost towns and near ghost towns are part of a larger boom and bust cycle. The state has certainly had its moments of growth, but for every burst the state has seen, the state has drawn back, leaving shadows of all the  people that once were spread across the state.</div>
